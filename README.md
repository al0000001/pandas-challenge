# Analysis Report

<!-- Report back ground

This report include below key information for analysis and understanding:

Total schools, School type, Total students, Total budget, Average maths score, Average reading score, % Passing maths, % Passing reading % Overall Passing.

There are four key summary based on analysis 

-From Local Government area point,
average maths score is similar with average reading score which around 70, and overall passing of Maths is slightly higher than overall passing for reading ~2bps. Overall passing is 72.8% 

-From School performing point,
Griffin High school has the highest overall passing rate 81% followed with 91% students pass on math and 88 % pass reading.
Ford High school has the lowest overall passing rate 67% followed with 82% students pass on math and 82 % pass reading.

-For the subject of Math,
Bailey has stable average maths score among year 9 to year 12
Holden high school has large fluctuation score amount year 9 to year 12

-For the subject of reading,
Cabrera High School has stable average reading score among year 9 to year 12
Holden high school has most large fluctuation score amount year 9 to year 12

There are two key conclusion which drawn by this analysis:

1.There is a negative correlation between school size with overall passing rate
From analysis small school size has the highest score/passing rate all below categories compared with medium and large size:
Average maths score, Average reading score, % Passing maths, % Passing reading % Overall Passing.

2.Independ school are scored better than government school for all below categories:
Average maths score, Average reading score, % Passing maths, % Passing reading % Overall Passing.

3.there are not many clear indications for relationship between budget spent on student with students academic performance, as spending between $585-630 has the highest overall performance compared with either highest spending or lowest spending. -->
